2. Define unicasting, multicasting and broadcasting

• Data is transmitted over a network by three methods such as unicast, multicast and broadcast
• Information is sent from a single user to a single receiver. This is used for point to point communications. If you have to send information to multiple receivers, then you would have to send multiple unicast messages
• In this mode of communication, data is sent from one or more sources to multiple destinations. Multicast uses the internet group managament protocol to identify groups
• It is known as to 1 to all. The communication is between a single user and multiple receiver

What is DNS?
Domain Name System. It is like internet's phone book that is responsible for mapping the domain name into its corressponding IP address

What is firewall?
Firewall is a hardware or software that is responsible for blocking either incoming or outgoing traffic from the internet to your computer. They secure a network

Types of Firewall

1. Packet Filtering firewalls
They are the most common type of firewalls which analyze packets and let them pass through only if they match an estbablished secuirty rule set
Proxy firewall
* These firewalls filter network traffic at the application level

Stateful multilayer inspection (SMLI) firewalls
* They filter packets at the network, transport and application layers. The packets are compared to the known trusted packets
* Virtual private network is a connection between a VPN server and a vpn client. It is secure tunnel across the internet

• Distributed processing is a term which describes various computer systems that use more that one processor to run the application. Here multiple computers across different locations share the same processor. 

Advantages of Distributed processing are
• Data recovery
• Lower cost
• Reliable
• Easy to expand
* If there is loss of data in one computer, then it can be recovered by another interconnected computer
* A glitch in one machine does not affect the processing as there will be multiple other machines
* Several cost-effective minicomputers are used instead of costlier mainframe machines

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Domain
• It is centralized network model
• One administrator manages the domain and its resources
• Good for large networks
• The computer can be connected to any network
Workgroup
• It is a decentralized network
• Every user manages the resources individully on their PCs
• Good for small network
• All the computer should be connected to the same LAN
Data encapsulation refers to the process of adding header and trailers to the data.
The data link layer binds each packet into a frame that contains the hardware addressof the source and the destination computer
* A router masks the local IP address of each device and uses a single IP address when communicating with hardware outside the local network
LAN 
Advantages
• Single central control unit, used to store system data
• Transfer of data and information becomes easier and sharing network services

Disadvantages
• Data secuirty is compromised if the LAN admin decided to steal data and information
• Require constant for continuing data dirstirbuting hardware


Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)
 is a network type that encompasses network connection of an entire city, or connection of a small area. The area covered is less in comparison to WAN and faces moderate network traffic in the channel
* MAN covers a large geographical area and is also used as an ISP(Internet Service Provider), and the connection medium is generally wired for efficient data transfer
* MAN applies many networks devices for smooth data services and is connected through telephone lines, to provide high-speed internet services

Advantages 
• Apply fiber optic cables for high speed data transfer
• Connection area covers at most an entire city, or some parts of it. It also allows full duplex data exchange

Disadvantage
• Need for good qaulity hardware and cost of installing is very high
