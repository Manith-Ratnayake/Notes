Computer viruses explained

Malware
• Everything that is intentionally designed to cause interuptions to a computer, leak private information, gain unauthorized access to information system, deprive access to information system or unknowingly interfere with the users computer secuirty and privacy


Virus
• A type of malware that when executed replicates iteself by modifying other computer programs and inserting its own code into the program. If this succeeds the affected areeas are then said to be infected. Just like biological viruses. Generally requires a host program and writing its own code into it and when the host program runs, executing its own code first it causes infection and damage. It causes damage by system failures, corrupting data, wasting computer resources, increasing the maintainance cost or stealing peronal information 

Worm
• Standalone computer malware that replicate itself in order to spread to other computers. Most of the time it uses a computer network to spread itself. Worm will 
contiunosly scan to other computers. This behaviour continues exponentially increase it replication. Causes harm to network. Even by consuming bandwidth 

Trojan
• Any malware that mislead user true intent by disguisng itself as standard program. Generally spread from some form of social engineering. As example user is duped into open a email attachment or by clicking fake advertistment. Trojan only explain how it enters the computer

Malwertising 
• Use of advertising in highly reputable websites to spread malware. Push their attacks to web users who might not see the ad due to firewall or safety precaustion in general. They can easily spread across a large number of legitimate websites without directly compromising those websites. Does not require ANY USERE INTERACTION like clicking to compromise the computer, does not exploit any web vulnerability 

RAT (Remote Access Trojan)
• Malware tpe that remotely controll the computer through the internet. When cimputer is ratted, hacker can move the mouse, type, look at the person from the webcam & record it etc. Most of the time it says silent and access the keylogger to gain your personal information 

Backdoor 
• Authorized or unauthroized users able to get around normal secuirty measures.Can be used to steal personal/fincail data, install malware, hijack devices

Rootkit
• A program or collection of malicious software tools that give threat active remote access to control over a computer. Legitamate cases such as provide enduser support most rootkits open a back door on victim systems to malware and further network security attacks. Often prevent detection by deactivating antivirus softwares. Removal can be complicated or practically impossible if the rootkit is reside the kernal  

Spyware
• Malware infects the computer and secretly gathers information about the user. The sites visited, downloaded files, username & password, email information. After the information gathered it may be used to exploit or sold

Keylogger
• Malware that secretly record what user is typing and then sending it to the hacker. TYpe of spyware


Ransomware
• Permanently block access to the victim's personal data and computer unless a ransom is paid. Some ransomwares lock the system without damaging the files, more advance malware uses a technique called 'cryptoviral extortion'. It encrypt the users files make it inaccessible ask a ransom payment to encrypt them


Filess malware
• It exist as a computer memory based malware. Such as RAM. Does not write any activity to hard drive. This make it difficult to detect and leaves little evidence. Used by hackers quick and stealthy operations. Used to gather data quickly since most of them are deleted once the computer is rebooted.

Adware 
• Malware install on to the computer without the knowledge often when downloading other softwares and display ads user browse the internet. Some of them are used as a spywae to collect or sold into targeted ads. Recognizable one is open a opup in an unclosable window 

RAM scraper
• Install into a sale systems to collect personal information about like credit card numbers and pins of consumers. 

DDoS
• Hacker tries to make a computer or connection unavailable. Flooding the targetet computer with superflous files in an attempt to over load them and prevent some or all legitamte request from being fulfiiled. The originated incoming is from different sources. Most of the time other infected computers as bots in a bot net

Brower Hijacking
• Unwanted software that changes a web browser settings without the user's permission to inject unwanted ads, change the homepage or even the search engine as a whole, installing its own. Many browser hijacking programs are accidently installed while installing other software that as a bundle in their installer and they often come up uninstall instructions or are presented in a way that is confusing for average users to trick them into installing unwanted extra software  

Cryptojacking
• Act of secretly exposing a computer to mine cryptocurencies. Its goal is stay silent as possible and mine as many coin as possible for profit. If the computer becomes victim of this practise it greatly slows down and risks breaking some of its hardware in the long run

Rogue secuirty software
• Form of internet fraud that misleads users into believing users that there is a virus in their computer and aims to convince them to pay for a fake malware removal tool that actually installs malware on the computer. Usualy spread through malvertising.  

Phising
• Scam which attackers deceiving people into revealing sensitive information or installing malware. Most of them are done by emails. where the attacker act as a reputable sources such as bank and sends the victim to a website that completly mirrors the real one. Once the vitim is logs in using their passsword. It gets sent to the attacker.
• It can also perpetrated through phone calls where the attacker spoof his number to appear as it is coming from a legitamate instition or through SMS.
• Phising is an example of social engiinering


Hybrid Malware
• Refers to as use of 2 or more malware by an attacker in a single attack. Most of the time these combinations combine trojans and worms or adwares or viruses

Bruet force attacks 
• Attacker submitting many passwords in hope to gain access to the account with the hope of eventually guessing it correctly. Attacker systematically check all the possible passwords until correct 1 is found through automated software. 
short = easy
long  = almost imposssible
• When you fail to enter the correct password in most websites. It blocks for several moments

Wiper
• Malware intent to remove everything against the user's will. 

Social Enginnering
• Not a malware. Psychological manipulation of people into performing actions or divulging confidential information
