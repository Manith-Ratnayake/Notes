Classification of computer
        -- According to physical size
        -- According to technology

Physical size
        - Super computer
        - Mainframe computer
        - Mini computer
        - Micro computer   

Technology 
        - Analog 
        - Digital
        - Hybrid 

Printers
- Impact printers
    -- Dot Matrix printer
    -- Line printer
Printers that have a head or needle which strike against an ink ribbon to make a mark on the paper
Features = Noisy, Inexpensive

- Non Impact printers
    -- Laser printer
    -- Bubble printer/ Ink jet printer
    -- Thermal printer

* Transmitting data and information is called data communication
* Data transmission needs a connection between a sender and a recevier; such connection is called networking
* Should be 2 or more to make a connection

Data transmission mode
    - Simplex mode 
    - Half duplex mode
    - Full duplex mode

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Network Topology
is the pattern of connection in desigining computer network. 
    - Star topology
    - Bus toplogy
    - Ring toplogy
    - Tree toplpogy
    - Mesh toplogy
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Types of Computer networks
i. LAN     (Local Area Network)
ii. MAN   (Metropolitan Area Network)
iii. WAN   (Wide Area Network)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Most Significant Digit (MSD)    
Least Significant Digit (LSD)

Value 
329    = 3(MSD), 9(LSD)
58.32  = 5(MSD), 2(LSD)
1237.0 = 1(MSD), 7(LSD)
0.4    = 4(MSD), 4(LSD)
0.0975 = 9(MSD), 5(LSD)

Scripting Languages:
 pHp , javascript

Assembler : Assembly language code to Machine language translator 
Interpreter
Compiler

System
A system is a collection of component that interacts to achieve a specific task
Consist of three components
    : Input
    : Process
    : Output
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

System Development life cycle model
Waterfall model
Iterative increment model
Prototyping model
Spiral model

Waterfall mdoel
    : First identify requirements
    : Complete one stage before going to the next phase
    : The results of the developed system is found at the final stage. This model has a limitation of developing a system that is different
             to what the user want as the user sees the system at the end of the life cycle

Iterative model
* A system is developed through repeated cycles (Iteratives) and in smaller portions at a time (incremental).
* The process starts with a simple implementation of a sub - set of the software requirments and iteratively enhances the evolving versions until the complete system  is implemented
* At each iteration design modifications are made and now functional capabilites are added. 
* Allow software developers to take advantages of what was learned during development and use of the system

* The internet is collection of computer networks around the world

Cloud Computing
is the practise of using network of remote servers hosted on the internet to store, manage, and process data instead
of using a local server or a personal computer 
Main services of the cloud computing
        - Iaas (infrastructure as a solution)
        - Paas (Platform as a solution)
        - Saas (software as a solution)

Iaas = Provides a virtual environment of servers to provide space to store data and software application with the help of server computers 
    and also to provide various resources through the use of large data centers estbalished
    Ex; server space, firewall
Paas = Provides necessary sever environment for software development. This gives faciliates including OS, Programming languages, databases and web servers
    Ex; OS, compilers
Saas = Provides software installation in cloud without installing the software required by the user
    Ex; Spreadsheets

Advantages of cloud computing
* Improve performance
* Lower software cost
* Fewer maintanance issues
* Instant softwares updates

Static website
    If the contenet of the website is not changed for period of time
    technology: HTML 
Dynamic website
    If the contnet of the website changes over time. 
    technology: PHP  
    example: Current time, no of candidates selected

What you see is what you get  (WYSIWYG)
