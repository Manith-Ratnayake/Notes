Solid Principles


S = Single Responsibility Principle 
each class should focus on 1 single functionality


O = Open Closed Principle 
softwares should be open to extension but should close for modifications


L = Liskov Substitution Principle 
object of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting correctness


I = Interface Segregation Principles
A class should not be forced to implement interfaces it does not use


D = Dependency Inversion Principle 
High level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should not depend on abstraction
