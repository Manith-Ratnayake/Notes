[Machine Learning is the] field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. —Arthur Samuel, 1959


A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E. —Tom Mitchell, 1997



Even though it is regression Logistic Regression is good for classification problems 





Unsupervised Learning

Clustering —K-Means —DBSCAN —Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA) • Anomaly detection and novelty detection —One-class SVM —Isolation Forest

Visualization and dimensionality reduction —Principal Component Analysis (PCA) —Kernel PCA —Locally-Linear Embedding (LLE) —t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) • Association rule learning —Apriori —Ecla  

Most semisupervised learning algorithms are combinations of unsupervised and supervised algorithms.
For example, deep belief networks (DBNs) are based on unsu pervised components called restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) stacked on top of one another.
