Data Modelling
The process of creating a visual representation of data elements and their relationships within a system.

Key Concepts in Data Modelling

Conceptual modelling
Focuses on understanding business entities, their attributes, and relationships.
Independent of any specific database technology.


Logical modelling
Translates conceptual model into a more detailed model aligned with a specific database technology (e.g., relational, hierarchical, object-oriented).



Physical modelling
Maps logical model to the physical storage structure of the chosen database system.
Optimizes for performance, scalability, and security.



Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Reduce dimensionality while preserving most of the variance in the data.
Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA): Reduce dimensionality while maximizing class separability.
